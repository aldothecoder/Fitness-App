          <h1>Hip Circles: Step-by-Step Guide</h1>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 1: Stand with Your Feet Shoulder-Width Apart</strong>
            <br />
            Begin by standing tall with your feet about shoulder-width apart.
            Keep your knees slightly bent, and place your hands on your hips.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 2: Engage Your Core</strong>
            <br />
            Tighten your core muscles to support your lower back throughout the
            movement. This will also help you maintain balance while performing
            the circles.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 3: Start with Small Circles</strong>
            <br />
            Begin by slowly rotating your hips in a small circular motion,
            moving clockwise. Keep the motion controlled and smooth, making sure
            your upper body stays relatively still.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 4: Gradually Increase the Size of the Circles</strong>
            <br />
            As you get more comfortable, gradually increase the size of the hip
            circles. Make sure to keep your movements smooth and continuous
            without jerking or bouncing.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 5: Complete the Desired Repetitions</strong>
            <br />
            Perform 10-15 circles in one direction. Once completed, switch to
            the other direction (counterclockwise) and perform the same number
            of circles.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 6: Focus on Full Range of Motion</strong>
            <br />
            As you become more comfortable with the exercise, focus on moving
            through the full range of motion to improve mobility in your hips
            and lower back. Keep your movements controlled and avoid
            overextending.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Tips:</strong>
            <br />
            - Keep your core engaged and your upper body stable throughout the
            exercise.
            <br />
            - Move at a slow and controlled pace to avoid straining your lower
            back.
            <br />
            - Hip circles can be used as a warm-up exercise to increase hip
            mobility before a workout.
            <br />- If you feel any discomfort, reduce the size of the circles
            or stop the exercise.
