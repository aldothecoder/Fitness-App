          <h1>Deep Squat: Step-by-Step Guide</h1>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 1: Stand with Your Feet Shoulder-Width Apart</strong>
            <br />
            Begin by standing tall with your feet about shoulder-width apart.
            Your toes should point slightly outward, but not too muchâ€”just
            enough to allow for natural hip movement.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 2: Engage Your Core</strong>
            <br />
            Before squatting, engage your core muscles by pulling your belly
            button in toward your spine. This helps support your lower back and
            maintain proper posture throughout the movement.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 3: Lower into a Squat</strong>
            <br />
            Slowly bend your knees and lower your hips toward the ground. Keep
            your chest lifted and your back straight as you descend. Aim to get
            your hips below your knees if possible, moving into a deep squat
            position.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 4: Keep Your Heels on the Ground</strong>
            <br />
            As you lower into the squat, ensure your heels stay planted on the
            ground. If your heels lift off the floor, reduce the depth of the
            squat or widen your stance slightly.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 5: Hold the Squat Position</strong>
            <br />
            Once you're in the deep squat position, hold it for 10-30 seconds or
            as long as is comfortable. Keep your knees tracking over your toes,
            and make sure your weight is evenly distributed between your feet.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 6: Stand Back Up</strong>
            <br />
            Push through your heels to rise back up to a standing position. Keep
            your core engaged and your back straight as you return to the
            starting position. Avoid locking your knees at the top of the
            movement.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 7: Repeat</strong>
            <br />
            Perform 3-5 repetitions, holding each deep squat for several seconds
            before standing up. You can increase the duration and reps as your
            flexibility and strength improve.
          </p>

            <strong>Tips:</strong>
            <br />
            - If you're struggling with balance, use a stable object like a
            chair or a wall for support.
            <br />
            - Focus on opening your hips and maintaining proper knee alignment
            to avoid injury.
            <br />
            - Keep your chest lifted and avoid rounding your back.
            <br />- Practice deep squats regularly to improve flexibility in
            your hips, knees, and ankles.
