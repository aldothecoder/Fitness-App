          <h1>Butterfly Stretch: Step-by-Step Guide</h1>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 1: Sit on the Floor</strong>
            <br />
            Begin by sitting on the floor with your legs extended in front of
            you. Sit up tall with your back straight, keeping your shoulders
            relaxed. This is the starting position for the butterfly stretch.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 2: Bring Your Feet Together</strong>
            <br />
            Bend your knees and bring the soles of your feet together. Pull your
            feet in toward your body as close as is comfortable. Allow your
            knees to drop down toward the floor, aiming for a diamond shape with
            your legs.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 3: Hold Your Feet</strong>
            <br />
            Grasp your feet or ankles with both hands. Keep your spine straight
            and avoid rounding your back. Use your elbows to gently press down
            on your thighs to deepen the stretch if needed.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 4: Gently Lean Forward</strong>
            <br />
            For a deeper stretch, gently lean forward from your hips, keeping
            your back straight. Move slowly and only as far as you can while
            maintaining a comfortable stretch. Avoid hunching your shoulders or
            rounding your back.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 5: Hold the Stretch</strong>
            <br />
            Hold the butterfly stretch for 20-30 seconds, or longer if it feels
            comfortable. Breathe deeply and focus on relaxing your inner thighs.
            As you exhale, try to deepen the stretch slightly without forcing
            your knees down.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 6: Release the Stretch</strong>
            <br />
            Slowly release the stretch by straightening your legs out in front
            of you. Shake out your legs to relax your muscles before moving on
            to the next exercise or stretch.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Tips:</strong>
            <br />
            - If your knees don’t reach the floor, that’s perfectly fine. Focus
            on flexibility over time, and avoid pushing too hard.
            <br />
            - Keep your back straight during the stretch to avoid strain on your
            spine.
            <br />
            - Use a yoga block or rolled-up towel under your knees if the
            stretch feels too intense.
            <br />- Try practicing this stretch regularly to improve flexibility
            in your hips and groin.
