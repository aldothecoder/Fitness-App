          <h1>Child's Pose : Step-by-Step Guide</h1>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 1: Start on All Fours</strong>
            <br />
            Begin on your hands and knees in a tabletop position. Make sure your
            wrists are aligned under your shoulders and your knees are aligned
            under your hips.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 2: Bring Your Big Toes Together</strong>
            <br />
            Bring your big toes together and allow your knees to spread apart as
            wide as is comfortable. Your knees should be wide enough to give
            space for your torso as you stretch forward.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 3: Sit Back on Your Heels</strong>
            <br />
            Gently sit your hips back onto your heels, lengthening your spine as
            you move. Rest your hips down as close to your heels as you can
            comfortably manage, while keeping your arms extended forward.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 4: Stretch Your Arms Forward</strong>
            <br />
            Reach your arms straight out in front of you, allowing your forehead
            to come to rest on the floor. Keep your arms extended with palms
            facing down, stretching through your fingertips.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 5: Relax and Breathe</strong>
            <br />
            Allow your body to relax in this position. Focus on deep breathing,
            expanding your lungs as you inhale and releasing tension as you
            exhale. Hold the pose for at least 30 seconds, or longer if it feels
            comfortable.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 6: Return to Tabletop</strong>
            <br />
            When you're ready to release the pose, slowly walk your hands back
            toward your knees and lift your torso back up to a tabletop
            position.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Tips:</strong>
            <br />
            - If you find it difficult to sit back on your heels, place a folded
            blanket or pillow between your thighs and calves for support.
            <br />
            - You can also bring your knees closer together for a more supported
            version of the pose.
            <br />
            - Focus on letting go of tension in your lower back and hips as you
            hold the pose.
            <br />- Use this pose as a resting posture between more intense
            stretches or movements.
