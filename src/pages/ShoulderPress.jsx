          <h1>How to Do Seated Dumbbell Shoulder Press: Step-by-Step Guide</h1>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 1: Set Up the Bench and Weights</strong>
            <br />
            Adjust a bench so that the backrest is at a 90-degree angle. Select
            a pair of dumbbells with a weight that allows you to perform the
            exercise with good form. Sit on the bench with your back pressed
            firmly against the backrest.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 2: Position the Dumbbells</strong>
            <br />
            Hold a dumbbell in each hand and raise them to shoulder height. Your
            palms should be facing forward, and your elbows bent at about a
            90-degree angle. This is your starting position.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 3: Engage Your Core</strong>
            <br />
            Tighten your core muscles to help stabilize your body. Keep your
            feet flat on the floor, your chest up, and your back straight
            against the bench.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 4: Press the Dumbbells Overhead</strong>
            <br />
            Begin pressing the dumbbells upward until your arms are fully
            extended above your head. Make sure your palms stay facing forward
            and your elbows remain slightly bent at the top to avoid locking
            them out. Exhale as you press the dumbbells.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 5: Lower the Dumbbells Back to Shoulder Height</strong>
            <br />
            In a controlled motion, slowly lower the dumbbells back down to
            shoulder height, keeping your elbows at about a 90-degree angle.
            Inhale as you lower the weights and maintain control throughout the
            movement.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 6: Repeat for Desired Reps</strong>
            <br />
            Continue pressing and lowering the dumbbells for your desired number
            of repetitions. Focus on maintaining good form, keeping your core
            tight, and avoiding momentum.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 7: Safely Lower the Dumbbells</strong>
            <br />
            Once you've completed your set, carefully lower the dumbbells onto
            your thighs and then down to the floor to avoid strain.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Tips:</strong>
            <br />
            - Keep your back pressed against the bench to avoid arching.
            <br />
            - Perform the movement in a slow, controlled manner to engage your
            shoulders.
            <br />
            - Avoid locking out your elbows at the top to maintain tension in
            your shoulders.
            <br />- Choose a weight that allows you to complete all reps with
            good form.
