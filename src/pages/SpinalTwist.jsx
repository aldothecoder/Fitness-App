          <h1>Seated Spinal Twist: Step-by-Step Guide</h1>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 1: Sit on the Floor</strong>
            <br />
            Begin by sitting on the floor with your legs extended straight in
            front of you. Keep your spine straight and your core engaged.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 2: Bend Your Right Knee</strong>
            <br />
            Bend your right knee and place your right foot flat on the floor
            outside of your left thigh. Keep your left leg extended and active
            by flexing your left foot.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>
              Step 3: Place Your Left Elbow on the Outside of Your Right Knee
            </strong>
            <br />
            Twist your torso to the right and bring your left elbow to the
            outside of your right knee. Use your left elbow to gently deepen the
            twist by pushing against your right knee.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 4: Place Your Right Hand Behind You</strong>
            <br />
            Place your right hand on the floor behind you for support. Keep your
            spine long and upright, avoiding any slouching as you twist.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 5: Hold the Twist</strong>
            <br />
            Hold the twist for 20-30 seconds, breathing deeply into the stretch.
            With each exhale, try to deepen the twist slightly, but avoid
            forcing it.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 6: Release and Switch Sides</strong>
            <br />
            Gently release the twist and return to the starting position. Repeat
            the movement on the other side by bending your left knee and
            twisting to the left.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Tips:</strong>
            <br />
            - Keep your back straight throughout the twist to avoid straining
            your lower back.
            <br />
            - Focus on twisting from your core rather than just your shoulders.
            <br />
            - Use your breath to help deepen the stretch, exhaling as you twist.
            <br />- Perform this stretch slowly and mindfully to prevent injury.
