          <h1>How to Cycle: Step-by-Step Guide</h1>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 1: Adjust Your Bike</strong>
            <br />
            Before starting your ride, adjust your bike to fit your body. Ensure
            the saddle height allows for a slight bend in your knee when the
            pedal is at its lowest point. Adjust the handlebars so you can
            comfortably reach them without straining your back or arms.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 2: Wear Proper Gear</strong>
            <br />
            Wear a helmet for safety and consider padded cycling shorts for
            comfort. If you're cycling in low-light conditions, wear reflective
            clothing and use front and rear bike lights to ensure visibility.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 3: Start Slowly</strong>
            <br />
            Begin pedaling at a comfortable pace. Keep your movements smooth and
            controlled, focusing on getting into a rhythm. Use a lower gear if
            you're on flat terrain or just starting out, and shift gears as
            necessary to maintain a steady cadence.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 4: Focus on Pedal Stroke</strong>
            <br />
            Keep your pedal strokes smooth and efficient. Push down with one
            foot while pulling up with the other to maintain a balanced and
            consistent rhythm. Engage your core muscles to support your pedaling
            and help you maintain balance.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 5: Use Proper Braking Technique</strong>
            <br />
            When slowing down or stopping, use both the front and rear brakes.
            Apply the rear brake first, then gently engage the front brake to
            avoid skidding or losing control. Keep your weight shifted back
            slightly to maintain balance while braking.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 6: Navigate Turns</strong>
            <br />
            When making turns, slow down and lean your body into the direction
            of the turn. Keep your inside pedal up to avoid scraping it against
            the ground. Use your body weight to steer and maintain balance
            through the turn.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 7: Shift Gears Correctly</strong>
            <br />
            Shift gears as you approach inclines, descents, or when you need to
            adjust your effort level. Use lower gears for climbing hills and
            higher gears for descending or when you're on flat terrain and want
            to increase your speed.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 8: Cool Down After Your Ride</strong>
            <br />
            After completing your ride, take a few minutes to pedal at a slower
            pace to cool down. This helps lower your heart rate and gradually
            brings your muscles back to a resting state. Stretch your legs,
            arms, and back after your ride to prevent stiffness.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Tips:</strong>
            <br />
            - Always obey traffic laws and ride in designated bike lanes when
            available.
            <br />
            - Keep your head up and stay aware of your surroundings to avoid
            obstacles and vehicles.
            <br />
            - Bring water to stay hydrated, especially on longer rides.
            <br />- Check your bike regularly for any maintenance needs, such as
            tire pressure and brake functionality.
