          <h1>Leg Swings: Step-by-Step Guide</h1>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 1: Find Support</strong>
            <br />
            Stand next to a wall, sturdy object, or bar for balance. Place one
            hand on the support to stabilize yourself.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 2: Stand on One Leg</strong>
            <br />
            Shift your weight onto one leg while the other leg remains free to
            swing. Keep the standing leg slightly bent and engage your core to
            help with balance.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 3: Swing Your Leg Forward and Backward</strong>
            <br />
            Start swinging your free leg forward and backward in a controlled
            motion. Keep your movements smooth and avoid jerking. Let the swing
            be gentle, especially if you are using this as a warm-up.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 4: Increase the Range of Motion</strong>
            <br />
            As you become more comfortable, gradually increase the range of
            motion of your swings. Aim to get a full stretch as your leg moves
            forward and backward.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 5: Perform 10-15 Reps</strong>
            <br />
            Perform 10-15 leg swings on one side. Then switch to the other leg
            and repeat the movement for the same number of reps.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 6: Swing Side to Side</strong>
            <br />
            Once you finish forward-backward swings, you can also do
            side-to-side leg swings. Stand perpendicular to your support, and
            swing your leg across your body from side to side, maintaining
            control and balance.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Tips:</strong>
            <br />
            - Keep your core engaged and your back straight throughout the
            movement.
            <br />
            - Start with a small range of motion and gradually increase as your
            hips loosen up.
            <br />
            - Use leg swings as a dynamic warm-up to improve hip flexibility and
            mobility.
            <br />- Make sure not to swing too aggressively to avoid injury.
