          <h1>How to Bench Press: Step-by-Step Guide</h1>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 1: Set Up the Bench</strong>
            <br />
            Adjust the bench so that it is flat. Make sure the barbell is racked
            at a comfortable height — typically just above arm's length when
            you're lying down. Use a weight that is appropriate for your
            strength level.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 2: Position Yourself on the Bench</strong>
            <br />
            Lie down on the bench with your feet flat on the floor. Your eyes
            should be directly under the barbell. Keep your back arched
            slightly, with your shoulder blades squeezed together, and your
            chest puffed out.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 3: Grip the Barbell</strong>
            <br />
            Grip the bar with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width
            apart. Wrap your thumbs around the bar for a secure grip. Keep your
            wrists straight, not bent, to avoid injury.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 4: Unrack the Bar</strong>
            <br />
            Lift the barbell off the rack by extending your arms straight. Move
            the bar over your chest and make sure it is balanced before
            lowering.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 5: Lower the Bar to Your Chest</strong>
            <br />
            Slowly lower the barbell to your mid-chest, keeping your elbows at
            about a 45-degree angle to your body. Inhale as you lower the bar,
            and control the movement to avoid bouncing the weight off your
            chest.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 6: Push the Barbell Up</strong>
            <br />
            Press the barbell upward, driving through your feet for additional
            support. Exhale as you push the bar up. Your arms should fully
            extend at the top of the movement, but don’t lock your elbows.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 7: Repeat for Desired Reps</strong>
            <br />
            Repeat the lowering and pressing movement for your desired number of
            repetitions. Keep the motion controlled and avoid letting the
            barbell wobble.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 8: Rack the Barbell</strong>
            <br />
            After completing your set, carefully guide the barbell back to the
            rack. Ensure it is securely placed before releasing your grip.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Tips:</strong>
            <br />
            - Always have a spotter if you're lifting heavy.
            <br />
            - Keep your feet flat on the floor for better stability.
            <br />
            - Avoid flaring your elbows out too much to reduce shoulder strain.
            <br />- Don’t arch your back excessively; maintain a natural arch.
