          <h1>How to Do Cable Tricep Pulldowns: Step-by-Step Guide</h1>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 1: Set the Cable Machine</strong>
            <br />
            Attach a straight bar or rope to the high pulley of a cable machine.
            Adjust the weight on the stack to a suitable level that allows you
            to perform the exercise with control and good form.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 2: Position Yourself</strong>
            <br />
            Stand facing the cable machine, with your feet shoulder-width apart.
            Grab the bar or rope with an overhand grip (palms facing down). Keep
            your elbows close to your body and your forearms parallel to the
            floor.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 3: Engage Your Core</strong>
            <br />
            Tighten your core to maintain stability and prevent excessive
            movement of your upper body during the exercise. Keep your chest up
            and your back straight throughout.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 4: Pull the Bar Down</strong>
            <br />
            Begin the movement by pulling the bar or rope down toward your
            thighs, fully extending your arms. Focus on keeping your elbows in
            place and only moving your forearms during the exercise.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 5: Squeeze Your Triceps</strong>
            <br />
            At the bottom of the movement, when your arms are fully extended,
            squeeze your triceps for a moment to maximize muscle engagement.
            Exhale as you perform this part of the exercise.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 6: Slowly Return to Starting Position</strong>
            <br />
            In a controlled motion, allow the bar or rope to rise back up to the
            starting position while keeping tension on your triceps. Inhale as
            you return to the starting point, making sure to maintain your
            posture.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 7: Repeat for Desired Reps</strong>
            <br />
            Continue performing the pulldown for your desired number of reps.
            Keep your form consistent, focusing on engaging your triceps without
            swinging or using momentum.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Tips:</strong>
            <br />
            - Keep your elbows locked at your sides to isolate the triceps.
            <br />
            - Perform the movement slowly to avoid using momentum.
            <br />
            - Keep your wrists straight and avoid bending them during the
            exercise.
            <br />- Start with a lighter weight until you feel confident with
            the form.
