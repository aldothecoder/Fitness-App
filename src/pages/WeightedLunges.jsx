          <h1>How to Do Weighted Lunges: Step-by-Step Guide</h1>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 1: Choose Your Weights</strong>
            <br />
            Select a pair of dumbbells or a barbell with a weight that allows
            you to maintain good form throughout the exercise. If using
            dumbbells, hold one in each hand at your sides. If using a barbell,
            position it across your shoulders.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 2: Stand in Starting Position</strong>
            <br />
            Stand upright with your feet shoulder-width apart. Hold the
            dumbbells securely, or if using a barbell, keep it balanced across
            your upper back. Brace your core and keep your chest up.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 3: Step Forward Into a Lunge</strong>
            <br />
            Take a big step forward with one leg, lowering your hips toward the
            floor. Both knees should bend, with your front knee tracking
            directly over your ankle and your back knee hovering just above the
            floor. Inhale as you lower yourself.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 4: Push Back to Starting Position</strong>
            <br />
            Drive through the heel of your front foot to push yourself back to
            the starting position. Make sure to keep your balance and avoid
            wobbling. Exhale as you push back up.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 5: Alternate Legs</strong>
            <br />
            Step forward with the opposite leg and repeat the lunge movement.
            Continue alternating legs for the desired number of repetitions.
            Focus on smooth, controlled motions.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 6: Maintain Proper Posture</strong>
            <br />
            Throughout the exercise, keep your chest lifted and your core
            engaged to avoid leaning forward or rounding your back. Your body
            should move straight up and down as you lunge.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 7: Finish Safely</strong>
            <br />
            After completing your set, return to a standing position and
            carefully set the weights down. If using a barbell, be sure to
            re-rack it properly.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Tips:</strong>
            <br />
            - Keep your front knee aligned with your ankle to avoid knee strain.
            <br />
            - Avoid stepping too far forward or too close; find a balanced lunge
            distance.
            <br />
            - Keep your torso upright to engage your core and protect your lower
            back.
            <br />- Start with lighter weights if you are new to weighted
            lunges.
