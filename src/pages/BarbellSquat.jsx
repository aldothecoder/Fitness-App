          <h1>How to Barbell Squat: Step-by-Step Guide</h1>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 1: Set Up the Barbell</strong>
            <br />
            Start by placing the barbell on a squat rack at about shoulder
            height. Load the appropriate amount of weight on the bar. Stand
            under the bar so it rests comfortably across your upper back, just
            below your neck. Grip the bar slightly wider than shoulder-width and
            ensure your elbows are pointing down.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 2: Lift the Bar Off the Rack</strong>
            <br />
            With a firm grip on the bar, stand up straight to lift the bar off
            the rack. Take a step or two back from the rack and position your
            feet about shoulder-width apart with your toes pointing slightly
            outward.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 3: Brace Your Core</strong>
            <br />
            Before you begin the squat, take a deep breath and engage your core
            muscles to provide stability for your spine. This is crucial for
            maintaining balance and avoiding injury.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 4: Begin the Squat</strong>
            <br />
            Start the movement by pushing your hips back and bending your knees
            simultaneously. Lower your body as if you're sitting back into a
            chair, keeping your chest up and your back straight. Make sure your
            knees stay in line with your toes.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 5: Lower Into the Squat</strong>
            <br />
            Continue lowering yourself until your thighs are parallel to the
            ground or just below. Keep your weight distributed evenly on your
            feet, ensuring your heels stay firmly on the ground throughout the
            movement.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 6: Push Back Up</strong>
            <br />
            Drive through your heels and push your hips forward to return to the
            starting position. Exhale as you push up, and make sure your knees
            track over your toes throughout the movement. Do not lock your knees
            at the top.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 7: Repeat for Desired Reps</strong>
            <br />
            Repeat the squat for your desired number of reps, maintaining good
            form throughout. Keep your core braced and your back straight during
            each repetition.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Step 8: Rack the Barbell</strong>
            <br />
            After finishing your set, step forward to rack the barbell. Make
            sure it is securely in place before releasing your grip.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Tips:</strong>
            <br />
            - Keep your chest up and avoid rounding your back.
            <br />
            - Maintain control of the movement; donâ€™t rush through reps.
            <br />
            - Keep your knees aligned with your toes throughout the squat.
            <br />- Avoid lifting your heels off the ground; your feet should
            remain flat.
